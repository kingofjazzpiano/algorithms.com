- Monaco Editor or CodeMirror: Provide an embedded code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other IDE-like features.
- Vuex: Manage the state of your Vue.js application, especially useful for handling complex data interactions.
- Vue Router: Handle client-side routing for your Vue.js application. Enables smooth navigation between different views without full page reloads.
- Axios: Make HTTP requests from your Vue.js frontend to your Django REST API
- JSON Web Tokens: Provides a stateless authentication mechanism that works well with DRF and frontend frameworks.
- Django Allauth: Handle user registration, login, and social authentication.
- Redis: Implement caching mechanisms to speed up data retrieval and reduce databreal-time
- Vuetify or BootstrapVue: Utilize pre-built UI components and styles for your Vue.js frontend. Accelerates frontend development with responsive and aesthetically pleasing components.
- Nuxt.js (optional): Enhance Vue.js applications with server-side rendering for better SEO. Improves search engine visibility and initial load performance.
- Docker
